								<p>I was born in America between Y2K and 9/11, the youngest of seven siblings (five girls and two boys). We didn't have a lot of money but somehow got by. Our working class neighborhood of <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>, got wealthy by the time I was in middle school. Salt our family was immune to the new prosperity. As my friends got priced out, I became the new girl in my own goddamn neighborhood! The new kids wanted nothing to do with my brown-skin family. Mom was <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>, (<span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>, and <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>,), while my father was of <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>, heritage.</p>
								<p>I hated my a deeply religious, stay-at-home mother. She paid the bills, managed dad's business, and took care of us kids, but her bipolar severe beatings/weepy apology cycle were dramatic even by <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span> standards. At eight years old, I asked mom if she was jealous of me because I was younger and prettier. She nearly killed me. The only things I admired about that woman were her beauty and ability to hide her violent streak in public. To this day no one believes my accounts of that house of horrors.</p>
								<p>Luckily I was dad's favorite. He was the neighborhood fix-it man. I learned that anything can be built or repaired with ingenuity and the right parts, even if sometimes those parts "fell off a truck." Gentrification replaced dad's "enthusiastic" DIY spirit with professionals who actually knew what they were doing.</p>
								<p>This drove my father to an early grave. When the desire to kill them all and everything they value didn't fade away, I started looking for fictional and historical role models to accomplish this goal. I needed to be smart, vicious, and agile. A sample of my top three inspirational forces:</p>

								<p>Looking up these idols in public libraries brought me to the attention of the CIA. Turns out they were recruiting, and my test results showed the "moral flexibility" they were after. They gave me the code name "Delgada" after several missions of espionage and regime change. My scientific and technical skills provided valuable expertise to governments, corporations, and organized crime circles. I left the Agency to go freelance two years ago.</p>
								
								<h2>About that so-called Agent K</h2>
								<p>Giving credit where it's due, the Taschen family didn't participate in my neighborhood's 2014 white flight. <a href="agent-k.html">Karen</a> was my us-against-the-world BFF. Kids and old people thought we were weird even before gentrification ruined everything. I loved corrupting her goody two-shoes vibe, and she probably thought of me as her broken toy (which was probably true when we were six). Our friendship officially died in high school when fighting over <span class="redacted" aria-label="redacted content"></span>. Karen's  now a big-ass sanctimonious tool for the status quo. Causing her to suffer is one of my greatest joys.</p>
