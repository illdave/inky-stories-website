				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Research for second panel was tougher than anticiapted. Not being Will Eisner, I need reference even for memoirs. I blocked off a day in 2001 to take reference photos of my old neighborhood in Springfield Mass. They tore down <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=110+cedar+street+springfield+ma+01109" title="110 Cedar Street, Springfield Massachusetts 01109 - Google Maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">110 Cedar Street</a> years before. Luckily there was no shortage of similar, almost-condemned ghetto tenement buildings. I used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=bay+street+at+marion+street,+springfield+ma" title="Bay Street at Marion Street, Springfield Massachusetts 01109 - Google Maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building on the corner of Bay and Marion streets</a> as a guide, taking refernce photos of all four sides. When shooting the final side, a dark alley, I accidentally stumbled a drug deal. I was able to convince them that my camera had nothing to do with them, rushed the building shots and got out as quick as possible.</p>
				<p>Emulating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bil_Keane" title="Bil Keane - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bil Keane</a> "Family Circus" style  was made difficult by the fact that he didn't draw black people. I merged known elements of his style (solid black hair + bumpy hair = afro). The bum is based on Fred Sandford, plus a Keane drawing of "a beatnik".</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Staging the first panel took about 2 weeks, halting my page-per-week progress. Decided to show the kid playing in a pretend battle, probably at the crack of dawn while Mom's trying to sleep. The living room is modeled after a few old photos, my personal memories and Google Image for objects (television, stereo, cowboy outfit, various background elements). I almost drew the wrong bus, accidentally using an '80s vehicle as reference!  The kid's reaction shot (panel 4) is based on my son's "Happy Dance". The circle panel is a nod to the Simon/Kirby comics of the 1950s.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Getting the terrain right was a struggle. The old west background in panel three came from recently-dicovered photos, not my memory. The composition is stronger in the new version. I used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Maneely" title="Joe Maneely - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Maneely</a> think pen for distant background technique. The old man is based on Clark Gable in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" title="The Misfits - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Misfits</a></em>.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>The subjective, asbstract wrap-up page! Color's been pumped up here, particularly in the first two panels. Hopefully this effort enhances the story. Every panel's a struggle, but at least I now have a larger vocabulary of <a href="../blog/coloring-like-giraud.html" title="Learning to Color Like Jean Giraud">different coloring techniques &amp; history</a>.</p>
				<p>The second panel's swearing symbols are inspired by art from Herge's <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin" title="The Adventures of Tin Tin - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Adventures of Tin Tin</a></em> comics. The "Turn Left Here" sign in panel 4 actually existed; due to a 1-point perspective error, my version is missing a flamingo.</p>

<h2>Story Notes</h2>
<p>You read that correctly: at six years old, I steal a horse from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Game_Farm" title="Catskill Game Farm - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catskill Game Farm</a>. In the background, it's a period story of growing up in a rough part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts" title="Springfield MA - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springfield Massachusetts</a> in the late 1960s. My neighborhood wasn't as bad as other American ghettos, but things were noticeably worse than other parts of the city. </p>
<p>As an cartoonist, there were a lot of "firsts" in this story: my first attempt at drawing children, horses in action and first historical period piece. My recreation of 1968 is entirely subjective, combining researchable facts with personal &mdash; if somewhat imperfect and fading &mdash; memories. For instance, I can still remember my living room, but had to look up period details like the television and stereo.</p>
<p>
This is my second story rendered with traditionally at 12" x 18", a departure from the <a href="http://www.artofthecomicbook.com/history/art-reduction.html" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">current standard of 10" x 15"</a>. The first was last year's "<a href="" title="Bottle of Red - The Dee Brown Incident">Bottle of Red</a>". Working larger is really cool right now. There's something about working with the same materials and paramters as Gold-to-Silver Age artists
