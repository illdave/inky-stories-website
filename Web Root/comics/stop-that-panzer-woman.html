				<h2>Kelly Green as Agent K</h2>
				<p>This is the chronological order of Agent K/Null Device stories, which is different than the published order. I tried to make it look like it was inked by <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drake_stan.html" title="Stan Drake (Lambiek)"> Stan Drake </a>, specifically his <em><a href="http://www.tor.com/2011/06/29/kelly-green-when-comic-strip-creators-go-bad-in-a-good-way/" title="Kelly Green: When Comic Strip Creators Go Bad in a Good Way (Tim Callahan, TOR)">Kelly Green</a></em> period. The bottom teaser is for the next Agent K story. Design inspired by <a href="http://kleinletters.com/Blog/the-danny-crespi-files-part-1/" title="The Danny Crespi Files (Todd Klein)"> Danny Crespi</a>.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Art stuff: original art is 12x18 inches. The hand lettering is my clumsy attempt at matching Artie Simek, especially the titles. Influences for drawing the black latex catsuit: Alex Toth, John Buscema, John Romita, <a href="http://talkingcomicbooks.com/2013/03/28/tales-from-the-archives-tarpe-mills-and-miss-fury/" title="June Mills, creator of Miss Fury (Talking Comic Books)" rel="external">June "Tarpe" Mills</a>, and <a href="http://www.francosaudelli.com" title="Franco Saudelli (official)" rel="external">Franco Saudelli</a>, with a touch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Stanton" title="Eric Stanton (Wikipedia)" rel="external">Eric Stanton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willie" title="John Willie (Wikipedia)" rel="external">John Willie</a>. </p>
				<p>Karen's about 26, living at home with her father while in grad school. Her bedroom is a lot messier than how I drew it. Among her female role models is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake" title="Nancy Wake (Wikipedia)" rel="external">Nancy Wake</a>, the World War II super spy known as the White Mouse. </p>
				<p>This is the first time wearing the catsuit and <a href="http://www.arollothighboots.com" title="Arollo boots" rel="external">6-inch thigh-highs</a>. She tells herself she bought them to go undercover at a fetish convention. Subconsciously, she might have been looking for an excuse to wear it.</p>

				<p>In the first panel, Karen's studying <a href="https://ladythatsmyskull.tumblr.com/post/52711634706/sexy-sexy-fight-club" title="Judo Tricks with the Block Cat (Lady That's My Skull)" rel="external">judo tricks of the Black Cat</a>, a 1950s comic book heroine.

The original art is 25.25 x 18 inches, my largest ever comic book image. To get the 2-point perspective right, I taped the art on my wall, then used pushpins to mark the vanishing points. Agent K's trash talk is lifted almost word-for-word from Golden Age superheroine comics.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>The global destruction didn't look this bad in the thumbnail/sketch phase. Drawing it for real changed my reaction, and Agent K's, from smug to regretful. Their government wants to destroy our world, but most of the citizens are just trying to live out their lives. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgCaX-wm3c" title="Doctor Who: Journey's End 'Destroyer of Worlds' (YouTube)" rel="external">Destroyer of Worlds</a>" comes from <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>This is the room from <a href="the-null-device.html" title="The Null Device, page 13 (Inky Stories)">page 13 of "The Null Device</a>," which I drew 7 years ago. I added more furnishings to tell the same visual from multiple angles. It's meant to feel as claustrophobic and sleazy as the wood panelled dens of <a href="http://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/g2442/american-apparel-ads/" title="American Apparel ads (Esquire)">American Apparel ads</a>. Their banter, expecially Agent K's response in Panel 4, is almost completely swiped from the <a href="http://tardis-regenerated.com/?p=109" title="The Third Doctor (TARDIS Regenerated)" rel="external">Jon Pertwee</a> era <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>The torture scene is inspired by <em><a href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-classic-the-mind-of-evil-100036" title="Doctor Who: The Mind of Evil (AV Club)" rel="external">The Mind of Evil</a></em>, a <em>Doctor Who</em> serial. Like the rebel Time Lords, Agent K and Delgada share a complex relationship of mutal hatred, admiration, and a warped kind of friendship. They're mirror images of each other.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Delgada is the Professor Moriarty to Agent K. They're equally obsessive about technology, winning, and fashion. Born Maria Cristina de la Delgada Torres Castillo, she and Karen were best friends until high school. Delgada is now a high-priced mercenary for governments, corporations, and organized crime. Here, she's developing a new weapon by combining Asgardian and Dalek energy. On long nights like this, she needs Thor's screaming to keep her awake.</p>
				<p>As another <em>Doctor Who</em> reference, that's <a href="http://tardis-regenerated.com/?p=109" title="Jon Pertwee (TARDIS Regenerated)"> Jon Pertwee</a>'s head on her bookshelf.</p>
				<p>Departing from my Alex Toth style, I tried to make it look like it was inked by <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drake_stan.html" title="Stan Drake (Lambiek)"> Stan Drake </a>, specifically his <em><a href="http://www.tor.com/2011/06/29/kelly-green-when-comic-strip-creators-go-bad-in-a-good-way/" title="Kelly Green: When Comic Strip Creators Go Bad in a Good Way (Tim Callahan, TOR)">Kelly Green</a></em> period.</p>
				<p>Delgada's logo is based on the <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> logo, designed by Gaspar Saladino or <a href="http://kleinletters.com/Blog/the-danny-crespi-files-part-1/" title="The Danny Crespi Files (Todd Klein)"> Danny Crespi</a> for Marvel Comics in the 1970s. Had a rough time figuring out original letters D and G. Hopefully the inconsistencies Ds reflect the era's free-form eccentricity.</p>

				<h2>The Classifieds</h2>
				<p>The ads are thematically based on those from 1980s comic books, magazines, and newspapers. This era of street-level advertising is so economical, direct, and free from pretention. Headlines describe the product instead of the brand, speaking directly to consumer need. I produced them in InDesign as if they were actual client ads, complete with page-proportion sizing requirements from my print designer career. Using old ads that didn't account for website addresses as templates was a unique design challenge.</p>
				<p>The rough textures are to make each ad look like the original art got Xeroxed too many times in production. Sometimes this meant scanning beat-up printouts from my laser printer.</p>
				<p>In attempting an Alan Moore deep-dive, I tried making this supplemental material relate to the story. They either work as actual ads in the Null Device universe (Heroine for Hire, Super Beings Needed), or point to my real-world friends or vendors (Hub Comics, The Good Stuff, Hubba Hubba).</p>

<h2>Story Notes</h2>
<p>This is a prequel to "<a href="the-null-device.html" title="The Null Device (Inky Stories)" rel="external">The Null Device</a>," in which the mysterious Agent K had a relatively minor role until the end. She was nothing more than my desire to draw a <a href="the-null-device.html" title="page 13 of The Null Device (Inky Stories)" rel="external">latex bondage scene</a> at first. As the story developed, keeping her as just a damsel to be rescued seemed so wasteful. By then, however, there wasn't any room to flesh out her character. And I didn't know her yet. Until last year, Agent K was a bondage drawing looking for character. </p>
<p>Years later, I wrote the next Agent K story <a href="enter-general-zaq.html" title="Enter...General Zaq! (Inky Stories)" rel="external">Enter...General Zaq!</a>" This began as a comparison between modern and classic comics. That began as a film noir, but developed in an Agent K superheroine story. While its premise is a bit convoluted, it does enhance her character. She had to be clever, to figure out how to win when the first plans failed. Since the entire story's a fight scene, her character is only defined by action and banter. </p>
<p>"Stop That Panzer Woman!" tries to address unanswered questions: If she's such a bad-ass, how did she get captured in "The Null Device?" Did she tell her father, the Director, about her adventures? Where does she live? Why does she fight at all...especially in tights and 6-inch heels? While a lot of these questions are still unanswered, "Stop That Panzer Woman!" passes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" title="the Bechdel test (Wikipedia)" rel="external">the Bechdel test</a> in flying colors.</p>
<p>Influences on Agent K's superheroine persona are from the Golden Age (<em>Miss Fury</em>, <em>The Black Cat</em>,) Silver Age (The Black Widow, Yvonne Craig's Batgirl, <em>Honey West</em>, Emma Peel from <em>The Avengers</em>,) and modern Goth heroines (<em>La Femme Nikita</em>, Charlize Theron's <em>Aeon Flux</em>, Trinity from <em>The Matrix</em>, Selene of <em>Underworld</em>.) Their common priority is proving their toughness and intelligence, while taunting and looking fantastic.</p>
<p>Hopefully future stories will define her private and social personality. What does she think is funny? What's her biggest nightmare, her worst fear, what drives her every word and action? I'm waiting for that "character writes herself" trope to kick in, but will probably have to discover the answers through a lot of writing and observation. Short of that, let's hope this story is at least entertaining.</p>
