				<p>The design is based on Marvel's early-to-mid 1970s shell, specifically for <em>The Avengers</em>. My first concept was the double-page spread fight scene, but the "Destroyer of Worlds" concept seemed more dramatic. This concept is based on the lonley warrior feeling of the <em>Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD</em> and <em>Tales of Suspense</em> covers.</p>

				<p>It's based on the font Interstate Black Compressed, but modified by hand (something I did a lot in the pre-Photoshop days.) The "G" is wider for clarity. Straight lines were easy, curved parts were not. Final art approximately 12 inches wide, ink on vellum. I got the idea of presenting the original art with a ruler from Alex Jay's "<a href="http://alphabettenthletter.blogspot.com/search/label/Anatomy%20of%20a%20Logo" title="Alex Jay's Anatomy of a Logo (Tenth Letter of the Alphabet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anatomy of a Logo</a>" series.</p>

				<p>Female characters were treated as children or hostages to be rescued by the male heroes (while being abducted and threatened by Marvel's third-string villains.) Despite being in the era of Women's and Civil Rights, the major publishers still regurgitated fan bias of the 1930s pulp magazine era.</p>

				<p>It wasn't always like this. Some female characters were portrayed better before the 1960s. Examples include <em>Miss Fury</em>, <em>Black Cat Comics</em>, <em>The Phantom Lady</em>, and pulps like <em>Thrilling Comics</em>. The ladies are still beautiful and in danger, but aren't waiting around to be rescued! Perhaps the devolution was fallout from World War II and the 1954 rise of the Comics Code Authority.</p>

				<h2>Kelly Green as Agent K</h2>
				<p>This is the chronological order of Agent K/Null Device stories, which is different than the published order. I tried to make it look like it was inked by <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drake_stan.html" title="Stan Drake (Lambiek)"> Stan Drake </a>, specifically his <em><a href="http://www.tor.com/2011/06/29/kelly-green-when-comic-strip-creators-go-bad-in-a-good-way/" title="Kelly Green: When Comic Strip Creators Go Bad in a Good Way (Tim Callahan, TOR)">Kelly Green</a></em> period. The bottom teaser is for the next Agent K story.

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Art stuff: original art is 12x18 inches. The hand lettering is my clumsy attempt at matching Artie Simek, especially the titles. Influences for drawing the black latex catsuit: Alex Toth, John Buscema, John Romita, <a href="http://talkingcomicbooks.com/2013/03/28/tales-from-the-archives-tarpe-mills-and-miss-fury/" title="June Mills, creator of Miss Fury (Talking Comic Books)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June "Tarpe" Mills</a>, and <a href="http://www.francosaudelli.com" title="Franco Saudelli (official)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Franco Saudelli</a>, with a touch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Stanton" title="Eric Stanton (Wikipedia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Stanton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Willie" title="John Willie (Wikipedia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Willie</a>. </p>
				<p>Karen's about 26, living at home with her father while in grad school. Her bedroom is a lot messier than how I drew it. Among her female role models is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake" title="Nancy Wake (Wikipedia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy Wake</a>, the World War II super spy known as the White Mouse. </p>
				<p>This is the first time wearing the catsuit and <a href="http://www.arollothighboots.com" title="Arollo boots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6-inch thigh-highs</a>. She tells herself she bought them to go undercover at a fetish convention. Subconsciously, she might have been looking for an excuse to wear it.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>The global destruction didn't look this bad in the thumbnail/sketch phase. Drawing it for real changed my reaction, and Agent K's, from smug to regretful. Their government wants to destroy our world, but most of the citizens are just trying to live out their lives. "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDgCaX-wm3c" title="Doctor Who: Journey's End 'Destroyer of Worlds' (YouTube)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destroyer of Worlds</a>" comes from <em>Doctor Who</em>.</p>

				<p>Delgada is the Professor Moriarty to Agent K. They're equally obsessive about technology, winning, and fashion. Born Maria Cristina de la Delgada Torres Castillo, she and Karen were best friends until high school. Delgada is now a high-priced mercenary for governments, corporations, and organized crime. Here, she's developing a new weapon by combining Asgardian and Dalek energy. On long nights like this, she needs Thor's screaming to keep her awake.</p>
				<p>As another <em>Doctor Who</em> reference, that's <a href="http://tardis-regenerated.com/?p=109" title="Jon Pertwee (TARDIS Regenerated)"> Jon Pertwee</a>'s head on her bookshelf.</p>
				<p>Departing from my Alex Toth style, I tried to make it look like it was inked by <a href="https://www.lambiek.net/artists/d/drake_stan.html" title="Stan Drake (Lambiek)"> Stan Drake </a>, specifically his <em><a href="http://www.tor.com/2011/06/29/kelly-green-when-comic-strip-creators-go-bad-in-a-good-way/" title="Kelly Green: When Comic Strip Creators Go Bad in a Good Way (Tim Callahan, TOR)">Kelly Green</a></em> period.</p>

				<h2>The Classifieds</h2>
				<p>The ads are thematically based on those from 1980s comic books, magazines, and newspapers. This era of street-level advertising is so economical, direct, and free from pretention. Headlines describe the product instead of the brand, speaking directly to consumer need. I produced them in InDesign as if they were actual client ads, complete with page-proportion sizing requirements from my print designer career. Using old ads that didn't account for website addresses as templates was a unique design challenge.</p>
				<p>The rough textures are to make each ad look like the original art got Xeroxed too many times in production. Sometimes this meant scanning beat-up printouts from my laser printer.</p>
				<p>In attempting an Alan Moore deep-dive, I tried making this supplemental material relate to the story. They either work as actual ads in the Null Device universe (Heroine for Hire, Super Beings Needed), or point to my real-world friends or vendors (Hub Comics, The Good Stuff, Hubba Hubba).</p>

<h2>Story Notes</h2>
<p>This is a prequel to "<a href="the-null-device.html" title="The Null Device (Inky Stories)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Null Device</a>," in which the mysterious Agent K had a relatively minor role until the end. She was nothing more than my desire to draw a <a href="the-null-device.html" title="page 13 of The Null Device (Inky Stories)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latex bondage scene</a> at first. As the story developed, keeping her as just a damsel to be rescued seemed so wasteful. By then, however, there wasn't any room to flesh out her character. And I didn't know her yet. Until last year, Agent K was a bondage drawing looking for character. </p>
<p>Years later, I wrote the next Agent K story <a href="enter-general-zaq.html" title="Enter...General Zaq! (Inky Stories)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enter...General Zaq!</a>" This began as a comparison between modern and classic comics. That began as a film noir, but developed in an Agent K superheroine story. While its premise is a bit convoluted, it does enhance her character. She had to be clever, to figure out how to win when the first plans failed. Since the entire story's a fight scene, her character is only defined by action and banter. </p>
<p>"Stop That Panzer Woman!" tries to address unanswered questions: If she's such a bad-ass, how did she get captured in "The Null Device?" Did she tell her father, the Director, about her adventures? Where does she live? Why does she fight at all...especially in tights and 6-inch heels? While a lot of these questions are still unanswered, "Stop That Panzer Woman!" passes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" title="the Bechdel test (Wikipedia)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Bechdel test</a> in flying colors.</p>
<p>Influences on Agent K's superheroine persona are from the Golden Age (<em>Miss Fury</em>, <em>The Black Cat</em>,) Silver Age (The Black Widow, Yvonne Craig's Batgirl, <em>Honey West</em>, Emma Peel from <em>The Avengers</em>,) and modern Goth heroines (<em>La Femme Nikita</em>, Charlize Theron's <em>Aeon Flux</em>, Trinity from <em>The Matrix</em>, Selene of <em>Underworld</em>.) Their common priority is proving their toughness and intelligence, while taunting and looking fantastic.</p>
<p>Hopefully future stories will define her private and social personality. What does she think is funny? What's her biggest nightmare, her worst fear, what drives her every word and action? I'm waiting for that "character writes herself" trope to kick in, but will probably have to discover the answers through a lot of writing and observation. Short of that, let's hope this story is at least entertaining.</p>
