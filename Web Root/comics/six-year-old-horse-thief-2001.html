										<h2>About This Page</h2>
										<p>Research for second panel was tougher than anticiapted. Not being Will Eisner, I need reference even for memoirs. I blocked off a day in 2001 to take reference photos of my old neighborhood in Springfield Mass. They tore down <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=110+cedar+street+springfield+ma+01109" title="110 Cedar Street, Springfield Massachusetts 01109 - Google Maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">110 Cedar Street</a> years before. Luckily there was no shortage of similar, almost-condemned ghetto tenement buildings. I used the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=bay+street+at+marion+street,+springfield+ma" title="Bay Street at Marion Street, Springfield Massachusetts 01109 - Google Maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building on the corner of Bay and Marion streets</a> as a guide, taking refernce photos of all four sides. When shooting the final side, a dark alley, I accidentally stumbled a drug deal. I was able to convince them that my camera had nothing to do with them, rushed the building shots and got out as quick as possible.</p>
										<p>Emulating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bil_Keane" title="Bil Keane - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bil Keane</a> "Family Circus" style  was made difficult by the fact that he didn't draw black people. I merged known elements of his style (solid black hair + bumpy hair = afro). The bum is based on Fred Sandford, plus a Keane drawing of "a beatnik".</p>

										<h2>About This Page</h2>
										<p>Getting the terrain right was a struggle. The old west background in panel three came from recently-dicovered photos, not my memory. The composition is stronger in  <a href="six-year-old-horse-thief.html" aria-label="full-color analog version of Six-Year-Old Horse Thief">the new version</a>. I used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Maneely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Maneely</a> think pen for distant background technique. The old man is based on Clark Gable in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Misfits</a></em>.</p>

										<p>You read that correctly: at six years old, I steal a horse from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Game_Farm" title="Catskill Game Farm - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catskill Game Farm</a>. In the background, it's a period story of growing up in a rough part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts" title="Springfield MA - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springfield Massachusetts</a> in the late 1960s. My neighborhood wasn't as bad as other American ghettos, but things were noticeably worse than other parts of the city. </p>
										<p>As an cartoonist, there were a lot of "firsts" in this story: my first attempt at drawing children, horses in action and first historical period piece. My recreation of 1968 is entirely subjective, combining researchable facts with personal &mdash; if somewhat imperfect and fading &mdash; memories. For instance, I can still remember my living room, but had to look up period details like the television and stereo.</p>
										<p>After a 10-year layoff from drawing comics, this was my maiden voyage in a <a href="../blog/digital-art-process.html">completely digital process</a>. This was in 2001, when how-to demos were rare. Other stories done this way include "<a href="shower-powered.html">Shower-Powered"</a>, "<a href="dead-by-the-pool.html">Dead by the Pool</a>",  "<a href="zips-last-day.html">Zip's Last Day</a>", and "<a href="the-null-device.html">The Null Device</a>.</p>
										<p>Check out the <a href="six-year-old-horse-thief.html">2012 full-color analog version</a> of this story, and a <a href="../blog/six-year-old-horse-thief-compare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">side-by-side comparison</a> of both versions. There's also a blog about my homespun <a href="../blog/digital-art-process.html">digital art process</a>, and an incomplete <a href="../assets/img/comics/six-year-old-horse-thief-2001/p1-wip-1.jpg" data-lightbox="process-digital-horse-thief" data-title="Page from Six-Year-Old Horse Thief: breakdowns on print-size Photoshop file, drawn with Wacom tablet">step-by-step demo</a> of how the first page was built (a lot of the assets are gone).</p>
