				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>An architectural historian told me these buildings couldn't literally exist as shown. The type of roof top decoration in Panel 1 bottom right wouldn't be used for skyscraper-height buildings. However, the page design reflects the protagonist's state of mind, prone to self-centered exaggeration. The building's height expands as Brian McGee's fear increases. By that logic he'd never hit bottom, but the page looks really cool.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Mimicking Ed Sorel's inking style wasn't enough. I had to merge it with my style of realism. Therefore, the cross hatching is designed to show layers of background building and hint and foreground details. The largest priorities on this page were scale and light. This made inking extremely time-consuming, but the end result was worth every second. Not having to write dialog was a plus.</p>
				<p>I liked this page so much I used it in my professional illustration portfolio. The big money in Boston at the time was in ad agencies. They were constantly looking for storyboard artists to draw happy people with wonderful products. This page ain't that, but does show off my superior drafting and media control. I thought ad agency art directors would be so impressed they'd ignore my inexperience with their needs.</p>
				<p>Surprisingly to me, my portfolio got the exact opposite reaction. Agencies thought it was too "editorial" and not "product oriented". In a city full of established professionals, no one trusted a young Op-Ed illustrator trying to be an ad man.</p>
				<p>One art director's reaction was even more brutal. He liked comics, and happily flipping through my tattered portfolio while chain smoking and saying "Good shit, good shit. How old are you, kid? Wow!". His enthusiasm came to a complete halt when he got to this page. He stopped, never taking his eyes off my drawing of a rooftop suicide and said "Dave, don't show this. I think of doing this every day."</p>
				<p>Wow. Who says art can't move people anymore?</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>More proof that this isn't a downtown, financial district skyscraper neighborhood. In fact, it looks surprisingly like the building across the street from my Allston apartment. The first panel was way inspired by a <a href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/03/09/a-year-of-cool-comic-book-moments-day-68/" title="Daredevil #181 - Comic Book Resources review Daredevil vs. Bullseye battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Miller Daredevil panel</a>. The right column zoom in's from Harvey Kurtzman. My God, I really don't have an original thought in my head.</p>

				<h2>About This Page</h2>
				<p>Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thompson_(writer)" title="Jim Thompson - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Thompson</a> novel <em><a href="http://www.broadstreetreview.com/index.php/main/article/Jim_Thompsons_Golden_Gizmo" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Golden Gizmo</a></em>, this story ends with unconvincing happiness. I wrote more follow-up, but decided at the last minute that the story should stop here. Beyond the story's shortcomings, I still dig the visual design. Even the cross hatchings used as a storytelling device, as our hero walks towards the sunrise.</p>
				<p>I can't remember why it's dated "82". Best guess is that I wrote some kind of draft back then, but never made a real story from it 'til '86.</p>
				<p>PS: Even the improbably cheery resolution wasn't enough to make this an ad agency portfolio piece.</p>

						<h2>Story Notes</h2>
						<div class="row gx-md-5">
							<div class="col-md-9">
								<p>This was done for my Senior Degree Project as an Illustration major at <a href="http://www.massart.edu/" title="Massachusetts College of Art and Design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massachusetts College of Art and Design</a>. My project was to spend a year studying the history of comic book art, then present my findings to my class, instructors and department chair. [gulp!] I focused on the developing history of content, technology and business, then showed how this history directly influenced the current industry.</p>
								<p>I turned in my essay and lectured with the world's worst slide show in May of 1986. To show the Degree Project's effect on my work, I ended the lecture with an original 20-page story called "Needs?". As my first attempt at personal fiction, it's poorly drawn, badly written and predicability self-indulgent. <em>(I'd show you the whole story here, but I'm trying to <strong>gain</strong> an audience.)</em> I focused on visual issues (inking style, page layout and storytelling gimmicks) at the expense of the story (clarity, consistency, character definition, research, plot and dialog).</p>
								<p>MassArt instructor <a href="http://lindabourke.net/" title="Linda Bourke - Illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Bourke</a> thought the last 4 pages worked better without the 16-page setup. She was right! The first pages were produced while doing the degree project (shooting slides, revising the essay, sneaking in last-second research). The last 4 were done after I turned everything in, a week before presenting. This and not writing dialog gave me the time to do these pages right.</p>
								<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshadow_(comics)" title="Moonshadow - example of 1980s comics by Jon J. Muth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon J. Muth</a>, <a href="http://www.edwardsorel.com/" title="Ed Sorel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ed Sorel</a> and pre-crazy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Miller</a> were major style influences. In particular, I wanted Sorel's free-form cross hatch inking technique without his Op-Ed cartoonish exaggerations. So my "new look" is really a lame impression of <a href="http://www.tothfans.com/" title="Alex Toth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex Toth</a> inked by Ed Sorel. </p>
								<p>Maintaining a 3-column grid was a very important number for my page design. For staging and storytelling, I used expressionist techniques pioneered by <a href="http://www.willeisner.com/" title="Will Eisner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Eisner</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub" title="Lone Wolf and Cub - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goseki Kojima</a> and the wordless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynd_Ward" title="Lynd Ward - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lynd Ward</a> comics. This story was made with love, dedication and the following art supplies:</p>
